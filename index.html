      <p>Hello, I am currently employed as a Senior DSP Engineer in the Infotainment Department at Li Auto. My primary responsibilities include developing audio algorithms that incorporate machine learning techniques. Additionally, I oversee the design and optimization of embedded systems and provide mentorship to junior engineers.<p>
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy collecting various audio formats, such as CDs, tapes, and vinyl, along with a diverse range of audio equipment including headphones, speakers, and vacuum tube amplifiers. My passion for audio and technology extends beyond my professional responsibilities; I am constantly seeking innovative ways to push the boundaries of sound.</p>
