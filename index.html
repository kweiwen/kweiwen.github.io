      <p>Hello, I am currently employed as a Senior DSP Engineer in the Infotainment Department at Li Auto. My primary responsibilities include developing audio algorithms that incorporate machine learning techniques. In addition, I am in charge the design and optimization of embedded systems and mentor junior engineers.<p>
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy collecting various audio formats, including synthesizers, CDs, tapes, and vinyl, as well as headphones, speakers, and vacuum tube amplifiers. On weekends, I teach music technology to high school students, covering topics such as Max/MSP, Pure Data, and VCV Rack. My passion for audio and technology goes beyond my professional duties; I am constantly exploring innovative ways to push the boundaries of sound.</p>
